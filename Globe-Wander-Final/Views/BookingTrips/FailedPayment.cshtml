                                                    <p>We noticed that you recently started a booking process on our platform but did not complete the payment. As a result, we were unable to confirm your booking and it has been deleted from our system.</p>
                                                    <p>We understand that technical issues or other factors may have interrupted your booking process. If you need assistance or wish to try again, please visit our website or contact our customer service team.</p>
                                                    <p>Please note that without a completed payment, we cannot guarantee the availability of your initial selection.</p>
                                                    <p>Thank you for your understanding and we look forward to serving you soon.</p>
